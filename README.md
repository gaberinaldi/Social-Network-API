# Social-Network-API

## Description

This social network API is the perfect solution to starting a new social media website. It allows for all the neccassary features you would expect while using similar sites, such as twitter for example. As an avid social media client I wanted to recreate the nostalgic feeling of a simplistic social media site, friendly for all levels of handlers.

This application was built using:
